Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (a.k.a. drones) with high-resolution video cameras are useful for applications in e.g., public safety and smart farming. Inefficient configurations in drone video analytics applications due to edge network miscon-figurations can result in degraded video quality and inefficient resource utilization. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for offline/online learning-based network edge orchestration to achieve pertinent selection of both network protocols and video properties in multi-drone based video analytics. Our approach features both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to enable decision making for selection of both network protocols and video properties in the dronesâ€™ pre-takeoff stage i.e., offline stage. In addition, our approach facilitates drone trajectory optimization during drone flights through an online reinforcement learning-based multi-agent deep Q-network algorithm. Evaluation results show how our offline orchestration can suitably choose network protocols (i.e., amongst TCP/HTTP, UDP/RTP, QUIC). We also demonstrate how our unsupervised learning approach outperforms existing learning approaches, and achieves efficient offloading while also improving the network performance (i.e., throughput and round-trip time) by least 25% with satisfactory video quality. Lastly, we show via trace-based simulations, how our online orchestration achieves 91% of oracle baseline network throughput performance with comparable video quality.
