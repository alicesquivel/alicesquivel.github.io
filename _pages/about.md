Hey! Thanks for stopping by my website. I'm Alicia, a graduate research assistant at the University of Missouri – Columbia, working under the supervision of Professor [Prasad Calyam](https://www.prasadcalyam.com/). I pursued my master’s as a Fulbright Scholar and now, I'm working towards my PhD in Computer Science. I have been working in the “Virtualization, Multimedia and Networking Lab” (VIMAN Lab) since Jan 2020, where I constantly make the best of any opportunity to further advance my skills, and build collaborators with other universities, faculty and students.

## My work and research
My current work includes, cloud computing, distributed networking, drone video analytics, simulation, and emulation environments, zero trust paradigm, and machine learning. Also, I've been working with various NSF-funded testbeds, migrating simulation experiments to real world use-cases and infrastructures, including [GENI](https://www.geni.net/), [POWDER](https://www.powderwireless.net/), and [FABRIC](https://fabric-testbed.net/). Currently, one of the projects I'm working on is the [FlyNet](https://sites.google.com/view/flynetproject/home) project where I'm investigating architecture and tools to enable scientifics to include edge computing devices in their computational workflows. My work in FABRIC includes in-network processing and end-to-end monitoring at the network edge and core, enabled through programmable data planes. 


## My background and history
I'm a mission-driven PhD student, with a passion for technology, cloud computing platforms, collaboration and teaching. I did my undergrad in Computer Systems Analysis at the Universidad Tecnológica Intercontinental from Paraguay, and I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Missouri - Columbia, USA.

## My intellectual communities
I consider my work as multidisciplinary, with the goal to contribute to the next generation of large-scale networks, as a priority domain topic in technology. In my projects, I've been collaborating with [RENCI](https://renci.org/) scientists, working with their FABRIC testbed, the University of Southern California, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, investigating architectures and tools to enable scientists to include edge computing devices in their computational workflows. I have also collaborated with the University of Washington, working with their [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) team,  as well as with University of Utah and the POWDER team, where I gained experience in the next generation cutting-edge experimentation of networking and the future of wireless networks.

I love challenges, and make things work. I spend a lot of my time in the computer, learning about new technologies, methodologies to find solutions to research problems, reviewing papers, and I often collaborate with people from other disciplines. I enjoy giving presentations about my work, and meeting new people in conferences around the world.
